# Personal Library

This repo contains my code to complete the Free Code Camp Personal Library project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/personal-library

## This project uses Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mocha and Chai for functional testing of http requests, as well as HTML, CSS, jQuery, etc. This project has been migrated from Replit to [HERE]().

- Please note that there are features of this 'front-end' that are not user friendly (such as submitting a form and receiving a JSON response in place of the website and having to refresh or navigate back using the browswer). This is because this was completed as part of a solution to a Free Code Camp challenge, and so is not really intended for general public usage.
