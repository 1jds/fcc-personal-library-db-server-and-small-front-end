# Personal Library

This is the boilerplate for the Personal Library project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/personal-library

## This repo contains my completed code for the Free Code Camp project 'Issue Tracker', which uses Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mocha and Chai for functional testing of http requests. A functioning demo of the project can be found [HERE](https://boilerplate-project-library--js1313.repl.co/)
