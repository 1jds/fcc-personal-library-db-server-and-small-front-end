# Personal Library

This is the boilerplate for the Personal Library project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/personal-library

## This repo contains my completed code for the Free Code Camp project 'Issue Tracker', which uses Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mocha and Chai for functional testing of http requests. A functioning demo of the project can be found [HERE](https://boilerplate-project-library--js1313.repl.co/)

- Please note that there are features of this 'front-end' that are not user friendly (such as submitting a form and receiving a JSON response in place of the website and having to refresh or navigate back using the browswer). This is because this was completed as part of a solution to a Free Code Camp challenge, and so is not really intended for general public usage.
